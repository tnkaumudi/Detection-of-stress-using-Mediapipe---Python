# Detection-of-stress-using-Mediapipe---Python
Image processing project to predict the emotion of a  person using mediapipe.
motion recognition is the process of identifying human emotion. 
Stress is a part of life it is an unpleasant state of emotional arousal that people experience in situations. Essentially, user's emotion using 
its facial expressions will be detected. These expressions can be derived from the live feed via system's camera.We detect an individual emotion
in each video frame and the decision on the stress level is made in sequential hours of the video captured. 
Our project classifies the facial expression into 5 expressions- sadness, anger, fear, happiness, surprise.Estimate Face and Body poses using your Webcam and OpenCV in real time
Collect and process Joint Coordinates using Pandas Train the ML model to classify poses from facial landmarks and poses.
Libraries and dependencies used-
Mediapipe: Provides face and pose models.
OpenCV- used for image processing.
Pandas- working with tabular data as dataframes.
Scikit-Learn:Building custom ML mode
